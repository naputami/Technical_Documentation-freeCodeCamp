I created technical documentation page for responsive web design certification in freeCodeCamp. The page can be previewed through this link https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/naputami/Technical_Documentation-freeCodeCamp/blob/main/index.html (Please dont pay attention to the content :( )

The user story can be read on https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-technical-documentation-page-project/build-a-technical-documentation-page
